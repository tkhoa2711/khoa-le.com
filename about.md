<p>Hi, I'm Khoa. Welcome to my personal website, wherever I write blog, put my
interests and thoughts, my public profile/resume and whatever I could think
of.</p>

<p>By profession, I'm a software engineer - that's what I like to call myself,
even though none of my official titles previously was it. That should explain
my interest in technology, learning technical concepts and developing software.
It would also means most of the blog posts here will be programming-related.
However, I hope there shall be more interesting posts flying around the corner
that would entertain you on other topics well.</p>
